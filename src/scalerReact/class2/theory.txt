How does virtual dom work in React?
Basically React make virtual dom in memory which is similar to actual dom. Since it is in memory as an
executable funtion. Changes in it are extremely fast.
Earlier changes in actual dom were expensive and any change in actual dom leads to re-render all the 
children of the nodes in the dom tree.
Now when there is change in state and due to which there is change in UI, react creates a new dom due to 
state change. Now react compares virtual dom, with new state virtual dom using diffing algorithm
and uses key to identify changes in diffing algo. After identifying changes it updates only the necessary 
part of actual dom saving the expensive changes in all the nodes which makes it really fast.
